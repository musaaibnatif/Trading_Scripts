# Trading_Scripts
The various trading scripts I have created in PineScript

Conceptual trading strategies I made on the charting platform TradingView.
Although only theoretical the most profitable is the RSI Keltner Strategy with a 60% profitability at the time of writing. 
The profitabilty fluctuates between 60-75%. 
All the strategies target small movements to identify a scalping opportunity with options.
